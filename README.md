### Author: Alvaro Henriquez
## Introduction
In this project the goal is to create a classification model that can accurately predict fraudulant online credit card transaction. For this purpose we use a very large dataset provided by the **Vesta Corporation** in partenership with the **IEEE Computaional Intelegence Society**. **Vesta** is the world's leading payment service company. The data comes from Vesta's real-world e-commerce transactions and includes 433 features. Many of these features have been engineered by Vesta's team.
## The Data
The dataset was supplied by **Vesta Corporation**, the forerunner in guaranteed e-commerce payment solutions. The dataset can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection/data?select=test_transaction.csv). It is not hosted in this repository as the file sizes are too large.
## The Code
The code can be found in the `src` directory. There you will find `preprocess.py`
